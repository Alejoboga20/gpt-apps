# Chapter 1. GPT-4 and ChatGPT Essentials

## Introduction to LLM

NLP is a subset of ML and AI.
ML is a subset of AI. In ML, we do not try to directly implement the decision rules used by the AI system. Instead, we try to develop algorithms that allow the system to learn by itself from examples. Deep learning is a branch of ML that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure of the brain. These algorithms are called artificial neural networks. They can handle very large amounts of data and perform very well on tasks such as image and speech recognition and NLP.

**_GPT-4 and ChatGPT are based on a particular type of deep learning algorithm called transformers_**
